CATEGORY="Devel"
SUMMARY="GNOME HTTP library for Win64 toolchain"
DESCRIPTION="Soup is an HTTP library implementation in C. It was originally
part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation, but the SOAP
code was later removed (and then later partially reimplemented...) Soup uses
GObjects and the glib main loop, and is designed to work well with Gtk/GNOME
applications. This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers on the
network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to the Gtk+
programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also supported for those
who want it)."
